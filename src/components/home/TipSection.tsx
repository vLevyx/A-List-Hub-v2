  "Always lock your vehicle to prevent theft!",

  "Start at the copper mine north of Montignac for a low-risk, high-return start.",
  "Always smelt ores before selling. Raw ore has no value",
  "Group up to run high-volume ore trips or protect each other from gangs â€” safer and faster.",
  "Use T (On PC) for push-to-talk. Good comms can defuse tense RP moments.",
  "A Positive+++ reputation gives you up to 19% market purchases!",
  "Avoid RDM, VDM, CL, and Metagaming â€” all bannable offenses. Read the rules!",
  "No tools needed to gather resources.",
  "Buy larger trucks like the M923A1 Transport Truck for 50+ ore capacity.",
  "Reach Level 7 Smelting to unlock faster furnace processing â€” huge time saver.",
  "Pick a profession like Police to earn money, and server reputation.",
  "Always stay in-character. OOC chat is restricted and can ruin immersion.",
  "Never Combat Log (CL). It's a serious offense â€” always RP through situations.",
  "Use lockers in major towns for secure 200-slot storage. One-time $1M fee.",
  "Helis are expensive and require rare HQ parts. Plan long-term before investing.",
  "Check ammo compatibility using ALIS Hub or weapon guides before crafting mags.",
  "Trust no one outside safe zones. Lock your doors â€” even when smelting.",
  "Follow the New Life Rule (NLR): stay away from your death location for a while.",
  "Track item demand in your phone â€” timing the market can double your income."
